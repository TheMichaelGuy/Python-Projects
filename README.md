# Python-Projects

Welcome to my collection of simple tools made in Python to do various things!  

To run these, download Python, open a command line terminal of your choice, navigate to the folder with the file you want to use, and run the command necessary ("py" with the filename.py and necessary arguments)  
The scope of most of these programs is limited to things that I normally interact with, but if there are any relevant problems, feel free to make an issue report.
